# R Markdown - This is heading 1
## Having 2 '##' is heading 2
### This is heading 3

R Markdown files have the extension *.Rmd

With R Markdown you can create quick and easy reports with embedded R executable code as below
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
head(mtcars)
dim(mtcars)
```

**This is how you make bold statements by enclosing with 2 stars** 

*You can also plot the following *

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(cyl), mpg)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(cyl))) +
  xlab("No of cylinders") + ylab("Miles per gallon") +
  ggtitle("Miles per gallon vs No of cylinders")

```

This is how to create a bulleted list

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

or

1. Bullet 1
2. Bullet 2
3. Bullet 3
